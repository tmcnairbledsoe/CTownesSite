                    <p>Charlotte Townes creates geometric abstract paintings.  Inspired by the color field movement, optical art, and modern abstraction, these paintings are characterized by large geometric fields of solid color that fills the space.  The images have a sense of three dimensionality, giving an optical view of an enclosed space or abstracted room within the canvas.  Charlotte is inspired by architecture that is filled with light and spatial depth.  She creates high contrast images that reveal playful interpretations of colorized architectural yet imaginary spaces.  As abstractions rooted in color theory, the paintings pair complementary colors at adjacent, intersecting shapes so as to create colors that harmonize in an evocative balance of light and dark.  Sometimes her work explores hard edge geometries, at other times takes on more painterly application with repeating strokes that delineate structural frames.  Her work explores the notion of solid and void and how layers of color can build up polygonal forms or carve out spaces from within those volumes.</p>  

                    <p>Charlotte has a Bachelor of Fine Arts with Math minor from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where she graduated in 2009.  She went on to get a Masters of Architecture at North Carolina State University in 2012 and currently practices architecture in the commercial sector at a firm in Greenville, SC.</p>
